## 3-Video-Recorder
This app provides a web-app for Michael Walker's robotics lab for annotating videos and exporting the data of the annotations. Students upload a video, create labels for said video, and add labels to timestamps in the video. Annotations are exported into a CSV format with for later data analysis by the students in the lab.
